            My name is Mazen, i'm a 23 years old guy from Egypt. I'm currently at the beginning of my journey as a frontend developer.
            Getting into this career was a complete coincedence, when a friend talked to me about it, then i thought to give it a try since i wasn't really sure about what i wanted to do with my career, and i fell in love with coding ever since.
